Notebooks to visualize pyfkpt capabilities:

fkpt_original_examples.ipynb: These are the original capabilities of pyfkpt. 
1) Here, we test the code to derive the 1-loop galaxy redshift power spectrum multipoles for LCDM using camb. 
2) Also, we show the AP effect as computed internally by pyfkpt 
3) We also showcase the code works for f(R) gravity.

pyfkpt_with_isitgr.ipynb: These are new capabilities added to the code to work with new MG models and semi-integrated with ISiTGR.
